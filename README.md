Advanced SSH config
===================

Enhance `ssh_config` file capabilities

This program is called by `ProxyCommand` from `lib-ssh`
It works with `ssh`, `scp`, `rsync`, `git`, etc

The new `.ssh/config` file become `.ssh/config.advanced` with new features and a better regex engine for the hostnames.
Each time the script is called, it recreate a whole new `.ssh/config`, so be careful, backup your old .ssh/config file !

Features
========

- regex for hostnames (gw.school-*.*.domain.net)
- aliases
- gateways (chains your ssh connections)
- includes (includes sub files)
- real local command (executes a command on the local shell)
